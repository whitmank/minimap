Bookmarks are dead. The primary goal of this application is to create an alternative system for saving pages on the internet, one that affords a better experience than 'reading lists' and 'bookmarks' in the following ways:

* Page groupings, sequences, and chronology in browsing sessions using history and page transition types.
* Spatial navigation between pages using graph representation.
* Tagging - manually, and/or automatically from page information.

On a higher level, the purpose of this tool is to visualize (content) space on the internet. Think about different "areas" of agit site like Youtube, or Instagram. It uses recommender feeds to navigate you to the content space it thinks will maximize your engagement (i.e. photography-gram, exercise-tube). The user should have more control in being able to navigate these spaces, not just gladly remain subject to the whims of the attention-maxxing algorithms.

The only way to do this on popular social media sites now is to create a separate account for each type of content you want to see, then to manually train your taste profile on each account to only feed you that specific niche. There is a better way. Make your own algorithm.
