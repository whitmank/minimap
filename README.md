Bookmarks are dead. My primary goal with this application is to create an alternative system for saving pages on the internet, a system that provides a better experience than 'reading lists' and 'bookmarks' in the following ways:
* Tagging support - manual and automatic. 
* Page groupings, sequences, and chronology in browsing sessions using history and page transition types.
* Spatial navigation of related pages through link trees/graphs and semantic visualization.

On a higher level, I want to create a way to visualize (content) space on the internet. Think about different "areas" of a site like Youtube, or Instagram. It uses recommender feeds to navigate you to the content space it thinks will maximize your engagement (i.e. photography-gram, exercise-tube). I believe the user should have more control in being able to navigate these spaces, not just subject to the whims of the attention-maxxing algorithms.

The only way to do this on popular social media sites now is to create a separate account for each type of content you want to see, then to manually train your taste profile on each account to only feed you that specific niche of content. There has to be a better way.

The pillars of my approach to this problem are:
1. Content Capture - saving, caching, "bookmarking", organizing
2. Network graphs - taking what you've saved and organizing it spatially so a user can navigate the spaces they've explored in a way that makes sense, and better remember the landscape.
3. vision/text analysis - organize websites not just by the link connections, but by content and semantic meaning.`
